dbt Project Setup with Databricks in GitHub Codespaces
This repository contains a dbt (data build tool) project configured to run in GitHub Codespaces and connected to a Databricks lakehouse for data transformations. The project includes a sample model to demonstrate SQL transformations on a hypothetical orders table. This README provides setup instructions and explains the purpose of each file in the project.
Prerequisites

GitHub Codespaces: Access to a Codespace for this repository.
Databricks Workspace: A Databricks workspace with a SQL warehouse or cluster, a catalog, and a schema containing an orders table (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount).
Databricks Access Token: Generate a personal access token in Databricks (User Settings > Access Tokens).
Git: Configured with access to push to this repository.

Setup Instructions

Open Codespace:

Go to the repository on GitHub, click Code > Codespaces > New Codespace.
Wait for the Codespace to initialize with a VS Code-like interface.


Create Project Structure:

Run the following command in the terminal to create directories and files:mkdir -p my_dbt_project/{dbt_env,models,analyses,macros,seeds,snapshots,tests,target} ~/.dbt && \
touch my_dbt_project/models/{orders_summary.sql,sources.yml} \
      my_dbt_project/{dbt_project.yml,setup_python.sh,install_dbt.sh,init_dbt.sh,run_dbt.sh,git_setup.sh} \
      ~/.dbt/profiles.yml




Set Up Python Environment:

Run the setup_python.sh script to create a virtual environment:chmod +x my_dbt_project/setup_python.sh
./my_dbt_project/setup_python.sh




Install dbt and Databricks Adapter:

Run the install_dbt.sh script to install dbt-core and dbt-databricks:chmod +x my_dbt_project/install_dbt.sh
./my_dbt_project/install_dbt.sh




Configure Databricks Connection:

Edit ~/.dbt/profiles.yml with your Databricks credentials (see file description below).
Store sensitive information (e.g., access token) in Codespaces secrets or environment variables:export DBT_TOKEN=your_access_token




Initialize dbt Project:

Run the init_dbt.sh script to set up the dbt project:chmod +x my_dbt_project/init_dbt.sh
./my_dbt_project/init_dbt.sh




Run the dbt Model:

Run the run_dbt.sh script to test the connection and execute the sample model:chmod +x my_dbt_project/run_dbt.sh
./my_dbt_project/run_dbt.sh




Version Control:

Run the git_setup.sh script to initialize Git and push to the repository:chmod +x my_dbt_project/git_setup.sh
./my_dbt_project/git_setup.sh


Update the repository URL in git_setup.sh with your own.

File Details

dbt_env/:

Contains the Python virtual environment with dbt-core, dbt-databricks, and dependencies.
Activated using source dbt_env/bin/activate.


models/orders_summary.sql:

A sample dbt model that transforms the orders table, creating a summary table with order counts per customer.
Materializes as a Delta Lake table in Databricks.
Example content:{{ config(materialized='table') }}

SELECT
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    total_amount,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) AS order_count_per_customer
FROM {{ source('ecommerce', 'orders') }}
WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01'




models/sources.yml:

Defines the orders table as a source in the Databricks catalog and schema.
Example content:version: 2
sources:
  - name: ecommerce
    database: your_catalog
    schema: your_schema
    tables:
      - name: orders




analyses/, macros/, seeds/, snapshots/, tests/:

Empty directories for future use.
analyses/: For ad-hoc SQL queries.
macros/: For reusable Jinja macros.
seeds/: For loading CSV data.
snapshots/: For capturing point-in-time data.
tests/: For data quality tests.


target/:

Stores compiled SQL, logs, and run results after executing dbt run or other commands.
Created automatically by dbt.


dbt_project.yml:

Configures the dbt project, including model paths and materialization settings.
Example content:name: 'my_dbt_project'
version: '1.0.0'
config-version: 2

profile: 'my_dbt_project'

model-paths: ["models"]
analysis-paths: ["analyses"]
test-paths: ["tests"]

setup_python.sh:

Sets up a Python virtual environment and upgrades pip.
Run to initialize the environment for dbt.


install_dbt.sh:

Installs dbt-core and dbt-databricks in the virtual environment.
Verifies the installation with dbt --version.


init_dbt.sh:

Initializes the dbt project with dbt init.
Navigates to the project directory.


run_dbt.sh:

Tests the Databricks connection with dbt debug and runs models with dbt run.
Executes the orders_summary model, creating a table in DatBricks.


git_setup.sh:

Initializes a Git repository, adds files, commits changes, and pushes to GitHub.
Requires updating the repository URL.


~/.dbt/profiles.yml:

Configures the connection to Databricks (SQL warehouse or cluster).
Example content:my_dbt_project:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: databricks
      catalog: your_catalog
      schema: your_schema
      host: your_databricks_host
      http_path: your_http_path
      token: your_access_token
      threads: 4


Replace placeholders (your_catalog, your_schema, your_databricks_host, your_http_path, your_access_token) with your Databricks details.



Running the Project

Activate Virtual Environment (if not already active):
source my_dbt_project/dbt_env/bin/activate


Test Connection:
cd my_dbt_project
dbt debug


Run Models:
dbt run


Creates the orders_summary table in your Databricks schema.


Explore Additional Commands:

dbt test: Run data quality tests (add tests to tests/).
dbt docs generate: Generate documentation.
dbt docs serve: Serve documentation locally (may require additional setup).



Troubleshooting

Connection Errors: Verify host, http_path, and token in profiles.yml. Ensure Databricks is accessible from Codespaces.
Table Not Found: Confirm the orders table exists in your Databricks catalog and schema.
dbt Errors: Check logs in target/run_results.json or Databricks query history.
Documentation: Refer to dbt Docs or dbt-databricks Docs.

Next Steps

Add more models, tests, or macros to models/, tests/, or macros/.
Explore Databricks-specific features like incremental models or Python models.
Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automated dbt runs.
Learn advanced dbt concepts at dbt Learn.
